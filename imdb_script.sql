# Segment 7: Recommendations:
# -	Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for the types of content Bolly movies should focus on producing:

/*The following insights were derived for RSVP movies after analyzing the IMDb dataset â€“

1. There is a downward trend in the number of movies produced over the years. Highest number
of movies were produced in the month of March.
2. Drama is the most popular genre with 4285 number of movies and average duration of 106.77
minutes. A total of 1078 drama movies were produced in 2019.
3. RSVP movies can focus on Drama genre for its future film. Action and thriller genres can also be
explored as they belong to the top three genres.
4. Dream Warrior Pictures or National Theatre Live production companies have the produced the
highest number of hit movies among all production companies.
5. Marvel Studios, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros are top three production houses based
on the number of votes received by their movies and must be considered for a global partner.
6. Star Cinema and Twentieth Century Fox are the top two production houses that have produced
the highest number of hits among multilingual movies. Since the movie is meant for a global
audience, these production houses are good contenders and should be considered for their next
project.
7. The top director in the top three genres with highest number of superhit movies is James
Mangold. He can be hired as the director for the next project. */
