# imdb_movies_analysis_using_sql

In this project, we are going to work on **IMDb Movies Database**.
The objective of this case study is to analyze the movie dataset using SQL queries and extract valuable insights to guide Bolly Movies in planning their new project. The analysis will cover various aspects such as table exploration, movie release trends, production statistics, genre popularity, rating analysis, crew members, and more.

## All the queries with SQL statements are provided in 'imdb_scrip.sql' file.
## I have used MYSQL for this project.
